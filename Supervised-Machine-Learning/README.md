# Supervised Machine Learning

Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training example

The Repository includes all the popular Machine Learning Algorithms Implemented using Sklearn and supported with Proper documentation, explanations, and diagrams.

The Repository consists of Two Modules Namely Classification which Includes Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, K Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, XgBoost, Light Gradient Boosting. and Regression Module which consists of Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso and Elastic Net.
